For an intermediate TypeScript project, we can build a Task Management API. This project will introduce you to working with TypeScript in a backend environment, using Express (a popular Node.js framework), TypeScript, and REST API concepts. We'll also use a simple in-memory database (objects in memory) to keep things straightforward, but you could later integrate a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
